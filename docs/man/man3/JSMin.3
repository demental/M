.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
jsmin.php - PHP implementation of Douglas Crockford's JSMin.
.PP
This is pretty much a direct port of jsmin.c to PHP with just a few PHP-specific performance tweaks. Also, whereas jsmin.c reads from stdin and outputs to stdout, this library accepts a string as input and returns another string as output.
.PP
PHP 5 or higher is required.
